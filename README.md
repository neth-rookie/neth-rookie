- # 📊 Python Portfolio Analysis Toolkit

A beginner-to-expert journey building an intelligent portfolio analyzer using **Python**, **AI assistance**, and **real market data**.

---

## 🧭 Why This Project?

This project started with a simple question:
> “Should I invest in this stock?”

Friends and family turned to me — a finance student and market enthusiast — for advice.  
As my interest grew, so did the need for a **data-driven decision tool** to evaluate portfolios.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Download & clean live NSE stock data using `yfinance`
- ✅ Handle MultiIndex, holidays, and missing values
- ✅ Calculate daily returns and simulate performance
- ✅ Separate portfolios by investors
- 🔜 Integrate backtesting for scenarios
- 🔜 Add AI-enhanced signals for “Buy”, “Hold”, or “Accumulate”
- 🔒 Note: BSE stocks require paid APIs (limitation acknowledged)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Pandas
- yFinance
- Matplotlib / Plotly (optional)
- Jupyter Notebook or .py scripts
- AI assistance (ChatGPT, perplexity, deep seek)

---

## 🧪 Use Cases

- Family portfolio tracking
- Investment suggestion support
- Simulated growth analysis
- Market-volatility testing

---

## 🌱 My Learning Highlights

- 🐍 From no coding background to managing complex Python dataframes
- ⚠️ Solved real errors like `KeyError: 'Adj Close'` and MultiIndex bugs
- 🧠 Learned data cleansing, portfolio logic, and return simulations
- 📌 Realized RegTech relies heavily on real-time tools like these

---

## 🚀 What's Next?

- [ ] Backtesting scenarios with custom logic  
- [ ] AI recommendation engine for portfolio health  
- [ ] Interface design for broader usage
